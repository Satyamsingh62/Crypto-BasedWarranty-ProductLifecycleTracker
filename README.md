# Crypto-Based Warranty & Product Lifecycle Tracker

## 📝 Project Description

A decentralized blockchain platform that manages product warranties and tracks product lifecycle events. It replaces paper-based warranty cards with NFTs that hold expiry data, product serial numbers, and ownership history, making warranty claims and resales more transparent and secure.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The vision is to establish a tamper-proof, transparent system for product warranties. This system will help both consumers and service providers by automating warranty validation, streamlining claims, and recording the entire lifecycle of a product on the blockchain.

## 🔑 Key Features

- *NFT-based Warranty Cards*: Each product warranty is minted as an ERC-721 token.
- *Ownership Transfer*: Users can transfer warranties when reselling products.
- *Expiry Management*: Each NFT includes an expiry timestamp to automatically invalidate expired warranties.
- *Serial Number Mapping*: Products are linked via unique serial numbers.
- *Tamper-Proof Records*: All warranty and transfer data is stored immutably on-chain.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integration with retail PoS systems for automatic NFT generation.
- Service center portals to validate and extend warranties.
- Link warranty data with IoT-enabled products.
- Create a marketplace for products with valid warranty NFTs.
- Allow staking NFTs for extended support/insurance.
